# thresholding-node
The thresholding node takes in a source image and outputs three mask images representing the portions of the source
that are highlights, midtones, and shadows, per the brightness values (0-255) that you set.

This node also can blur the lookup table that it uses to separate the three brightness regions, resulting in a smoother mask.
